# Kubernetes 14-18 Oct 2024

## Kindly check your lab setup
<pre>
- You would have received a new cloud login credentials for this week
- the demo login credentials you received will no longer work
- copy/paste between you local machine and cloud lab machine is disabled as per your bank policy
- After your first successful cloud login, it will ask you to change the cloud password, give something you will remember easily
- For example - if your cloud user is 24MAN2848_U12, then your linux user will be user12 and the password is rps@123
- the cloud login credentials and linux login credentials are different
- kindly confirm if you are able to access the cloud machine
